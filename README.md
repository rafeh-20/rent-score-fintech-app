# rent-score-fintech-app

Our team designed the system for a Rent Score Fintech Application. Our goal is to create a user-friendly platform that assessed rental applicants' creditworthiness, streamlining the rental process for property owners.

In our collaborative effort, we constructed a comprehensive set of diagrams for the 8 systems of the application. These diagrams include Use Case diagrams, Activity diagrams, Sequence diagrams, and Class diagrams, each playing a crucial role in understanding the functionality and relationships between different systems.

Please note that due to the nature of the project being closed-source, we are unable to share specific diagrams or code snippets. However, the importance and value of our contributions lie in these carefully crafted diagrams, which significantly contribute to the overall understanding and design of the application's subsystems.
